## Description
​
This Ecommerce website was created to simulate the marketplace in the Star Wars universe, aid the user in finding new recipes based on the dietary requirements. This simple recipe finder allows a user to search for a recipe and will return 10 results, filtered by the user's input. From here, the results will be appended in a card, with an image, a name and a favorite button.
​
When hovering on the above elements, the user will be notified with a series of hover elements, alarming the user that the are clickable links. When the image or name is clicked, it will direct the user to an external recipe with instructions on how to make the dish. When the favorites button is selected, it will append that dish to local history and can be viewed in the "searched history tab".
​
The "searched history tab", will display all the dishes the user has favourited and will have the option to clear all those saved recipes by clicking the "clear history" button, located in the center of the page.

As a bonus feature, a random pokemon will be presented on load and will randomise and present a new pokemon upon clicking on the "new pokemon" button
